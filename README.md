Determine Whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes


Getting a rapid understanding of the context of a patientâ€™s overall health has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare workers around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded by patients in critical condition. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system.


Submissions for the leaderboard will be evaluated on the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve between the predicted and the observed target (diabetes_mellitus_diagnosis).
